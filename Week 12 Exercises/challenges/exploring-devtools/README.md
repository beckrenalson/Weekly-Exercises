# Exploring React DevTools Challenge

## Objective

In this challenge, you will use React DevTools to inspect and manipulate props in a given React application. This exercise will help you understand how data flows through a React app and how to debug using DevTools.

## Tasks

### 1. Inspect Component Hierarchy

- Use the React DevTools to explore the component hierarchy of the application.
- Identify the main components and their relationships.

### 2. Locate and Inspect Props

- Find the `UserProfile` component in the DevTools.
- Inspect the props being passed to this component.
- List out all the props and their current values.

### 3. Modify Props Using DevTools

- In the DevTools, change the `name` prop of the `UserProfile` component to your name.
- Observe how this change affects the rendered output in the browser.

### 4. Track Prop Changes

- Find a button in the app that updates user data.
- Click the button and use DevTools to observe how the props change in real-time.
- Describe the flow of data you observe.

### 5. Debug a Prop Issue

- There's a `hidden` prop in one of the components that's not working correctly.
- Use DevTools to find this prop and toggle its value.
- Explain why the visual output might not be changing as expected.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this challenge, you will:

- Gain practical experience using React DevTools
- Understand how props flow through a React application
- Learn debugging techniques for React applications

Good luck, and happy debugging!
